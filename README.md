# word-search-game
Hello and welcome to the wonderful world of Wordsearches! Word search is a game where the user attempts to find a word on a board of letters in a certain amount of time. While learning about Javascript, advanced algorithms and data structures I wanted to see if I could implement some of the things I was learning. Developing a game with some complex components was the perfect solution! Though it may seem simple to create such a game, once you get into the components a lot of factors have to be taken into consideration. What other letters should be on the board? How should words be placed? How can we get a program to place them for us without tangling them up? These were all questions that I had to answer while developing this project. Wordsearch was created using a REST api backend built in Ruby on Rails, and the frontend UI elements were created using Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and css.

# Looking Forward:
